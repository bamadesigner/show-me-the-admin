# Show Me The Admin

The WordPress admin bar makes it really easy to move back and forth between viewing your site and editing your site but sometimes the toolbar can be intrusive. When you need it, you need it, but sometimes you wish it would go away, especially when testing out different designs.

"Show Me The Admin" is a WordPress plugin that hides your toolbar by default and enables you to make it appear, and disappear, at will by typing a specific phrase.

By default, type 'showme' to show the admin bar and 'hideme' to hide it. These phrases can be changed in your settings.

**Show Me The Admin is also multisite-friendly.**

Your "Show Toolbar when viewing site" profile setting must be enabled. If not logged in, a login button will drop down.

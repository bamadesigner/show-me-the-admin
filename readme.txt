* Hide your toolbar and make it appear by typing a phrase
* Hide your toolbar and show WordPress button in top left corner to click to appear
* Hide your toolbar and make it appear when mouse hovers near top of window

**Show Me The Admin is also multisite-friendly.** Please use the [Show Me The Admin GitHub repo](https://github.com/bamadesigner/show-me-the-admin) to contribute, submit issues, and suggest features.
